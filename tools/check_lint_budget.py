Lint Budget — ratchet for rules not yet in `.ruff.toml`
=======================================================
`ruff check .` reports "All checks passed" while 38 security/robustness
findings sit in the tree, because `.ruff.toml`'s `select` list omits the `S`
(bandit) and `BLE` (blind-except) rule families. Twenty `# noqa: S603` /
`# noqa: BLE001` comments are scattered through the repo suppressing rules
that were never enabled -- inert comments that read like a security check is
running.

Turning the families on outright is not available: `.ruff.toml` is protected
config (see CLAUDE.md), and a 38-error gate would just be switched off. So
this gate runs the extra families itself and holds the count under a budget
that is lowered as findings are fixed -- the count can only go down.

Budget lives in `tools/config/lint-budget.json`.

Usage:
    python tools/check_lint_budget.py            # enforce the budget
    python tools/check_lint_budget.py --list     # show current findings
