memory_gate (Claude Code hook) — PostToolUse memory file size gate.

Python port of .kilo/hooks/post-tool-use/memory-manager.js. Stdlib-only.
Memory files (.claude/memory/*) are loaded into EVERY session's context via
SessionStart/CLAUDE.md references, so unbounded growth silently taxes every
future session's token budget. This hook is the Claude Code counterpart to
Kilo's memory-manager.js (which only ever gated .kilo/memory/ writes made
through the Kilo engine — Claude Code writes to .claude/memory/ went
ungated until this hook existed).

Wired via .claude/settings.json:
    "PostToolUse": [ { "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
            "command": "python .claude/hooks/memory_gate.py" } ] } ]

Behavior:
  - Reads the PostToolUse JSON from stdin: {tool_name, tool_input:{file_path}}.
  - Only checks on Write/Edit/MultiEdit (matches memory-manager.js semantics).
  - After every such edit, checks char count of .claude/memory/*.md files:
      WARN at 4,000 chars — advisory message to stderr, exit 0.
      HARD at 8,000 chars — block via exit 2 (Claude Code re-prompts the
      model with stderr as feedback), demanding compaction before continuing.
  - Any error (missing dir, unreadable file, malformed stdin) -> silent exit 0.
